=head1 FIXED-WIDTH CHAR HUMAN RECOGNITION

=head2 PURPOSE

This repository gives you the tools to manage the conversion of some
printed text into electronic form, provided the used font is a
fixed-width font. The programs in this repository are the solution if
the usual character recognition software engines fail at recognizing
the chars, provided that your eyes and your brain can identify the
chars. The programs execute the boring repetitive tasks, the human user
is there to recognize the printed characters.

I use it to analyse a source code printed by a dot-matrix printer.
